    "# Cramers Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we want to describe the geometry behind a certain method for computing solutions to these systems, known as Cramer's rule. Cramers rule will not be the best way to solve a linear system of equation, instead, **Gaussian Elimination** will always be faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup: Two system of equations, two unknowns**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the setup here will be some linear system of equations, say with two unknowns. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$3x + 2y = -4$$\n",
    "$$-1x + 2y = -2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, this will also work with a system with a larger number of unknowns and the same number of equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this setup geometrically, as a certain known matrix transforming an unknown vector, $[x, y]$, where you know what the output is going to be, which in this case is $[-4, -2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}3 & 2 \\\\-1 & 2\\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c}x\\\\y\\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}-4\\\\-2\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember, the columns of this matrix tell you how the matrix acts as a transform, each one telling you where the basis vectors of the input space land. Which input vector $[x,y]$ is going to give you this output, $[-4,-2]$. Remember, the type of answer you get here can depend on whether or not the transformation squishes all of space into a lower dimension. That is if it has a zero determinant. In that case, either none of the inputs land on our given output or there are a whole bunch of inputs landing on that output. We will limit this to non-zero determinants, meaning the output of this transformation still spans the full n-dimensional space it started in. Every input lands on one and only one output and every output has one and only one input. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about our puzzle is that we know the given output vector is some linear combination of the columns of the matrix .\n",
    "The x coordinate of this mystery input vector is what you get by taking its dot product with the first basis vector $[1, 0]$, likewise the y-coordinate is what you get by dotting it with the second basis vector $[0,1]$. We hope that that after the transformation the dot products with the transformed version of the mystery vector with the transformed versions of the basis vectors will also be these coordinates $x, y$. That would be fantastic because we know the transformed versions of each of these vectors. Just one problem: **this is not at all true!**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most linear transformations, the dot product before and after the transformation will be very different. For example, you could have two vectors generally pointing in the same direction, with a positive dot product, which gets pulled away from each other during the transformation, in such a way that they then have a negative dot product. Likewise, if things start off perpendicular, with dot product zero, like the two basis vectors, theres no guarantee that they will stay perpendicular after the transformation, that is they do not preserve that zero dot product. In the example above, dot products aren't preserved. They tend to get bigger since most vectors are getting stretched. In fact, transformations which do preserve dot products are special enough to have their own name: **Orthonormal transformations**. These are the ones which leave all the basis vectors perpendicular to each other with unit lengths. We often think of these as rotational matrices, corresponding to rigid motion, with no stretching, squishing or morphing. if $T(\\vec{v})\\cdot T(\\vec{w}) = \\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w} \\ \\text{for all } \\vec{v} \\text{ and } \\vec{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving a linear system with an orthonormal matrix is very easy, since dot products are preserved, taking the dot product between the output vector and all the columns of your matrix will be the same as taking the dot products between the input vector and all the basis vectors, which is the same as finding the coordinates of the input vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The left matrix below is orthonormal\n",
    "$$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\\cos(30^\\circ) & -\\sin(30^\\circ) \\\\ \\sin(30^\\circ) & \\cos(30^\\circ) \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x\\\\y\\end{array}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\2\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So in that very special case, $x$ would be the dot product of the first column with the output vector, and $y$ would be the dot product of the second column with the output vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\2\\end{array}\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\cos(30^\\circ) \\\\ \\sin(30^\\circ)\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\2\\end{array}\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\begin{array}{c}-\\sin(30^\\circ) \\\\ \\cos(30^\\circ) \\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even though this idea breaks down for most linear systems, it points us in the direction of something to look for, is there an alternate geometric understanding for the coordinates of our input vector which remains unchanged after the transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "If having issues mulling over the idea of determinants, take this idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the parallelogram defined by the first basis vector, $\\hat{i}$ and the mystery input vector $[x,y]$. The area of this parallelogram is its base, 1, times the height perpendicular to that base, which is the y-coordinate of our input vector. So, the area of this parallelogram is sort of a screwy roundabout way to describe the vector's y-coordinate. We should be thinking of the signed area of this parallelogram, that way, a vector with negative y-coordinate would correspond to a negative area for this parallelogram. Symmetrically, if you look at the parallelogram spanned by the vector and the second basis vector, $\\hat{j}$, its area will be the x-coordinate of the vector. Again, its a strange way to represent the x-coordinate, but it will all come together soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3-dimensions, ordinarily the way you might think of one of a vector's coordinate, say its z-coordinate would be to take its dot product with the third standard basis vector $\\hat{k}$. But instead, consider the parallelepiped it creates with the other two basis vectors, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & x\\\\0 & 1 & y\\\\0 & 0 &z\\end{array}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of the square with aea 1 spanned by $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ as the base of this guy, then its volume is the same its height, which is the third coordinate of our vector. Likewise, the wacky way to think about any other coordinate of this vector is to form a parallelepiped between this vector an all the basis vectors other than the one cooresponding to the one your looking for, and get its volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & x & 0\\\\0 & y & 0\\\\0 & z &1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}x & 0 & 0\\\\y & 1 & 0\\\\z & 0 &1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, rather, we should talk about the signed volume of these parallelepipeds, in the sense described in the determinant video, where the order in which you list the three vectors matters and you're using the right-hand rule. That way negative coordinates still make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why think of coordinates as areas and volumes like this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well as you apply some matrix transformation, the areas of the parallelograms don't stay the same, they may get scaled up or down. But this is a key idea of determinants, all these areas get scaled by the same amount. Namely, the determinant of our transformation matrix. For example, if you look the parallelogram spanned by the vector where your first basis vector lands, which is the first column of the matrix, and the transformed version $[x,y]$, - whats is its area? Well this is transformed version of that parallelogram we were looking at earlier, whose area was the y-coordinate of the mystery input vector, so its area will be the determinant of the transformation multiplied by that y coordinate. So the y-coordinate of our mystery input vector is the area of this parallelogram. So, the y-coordinate of our mystery input vector is the area of this parallelogram, spanned by the first column of the matrix and the output vector, divided by the determinant of the full transformation. How do you get that area? Well, we know the coordinates for where the mystery input vector lands, that's the whole point of a linear system of equations. So, we create a matrix whose first column is the same as that of our matrix, and whose second column in the output vector, and take its determinant. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x \\\\ y \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}4 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{det}(A)} = \\frac{\\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 4 \\\\ 0 & 2\\end{array}\\right]\\right)}{\\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So just using data from the output of the transformation, namely the columns of the matrix and the coordinates of our output vector, we can recover the y-coordinate of our mystery input vector. So this means we can solve for y by taking the area of this new mystery input vector. Likewise the same idea can get you the x-coordinate. Look at the parallelogram we defined early which encodes the x-coordinate of the myster input vector, spanned by the input vector and $\\hat{j}$. The transformed version of this guy is spanned by the output vector and the second column of the matrix, and its area will have been multiplied by the determinant of the matrix. So the x-coordinate of our mystery input vector is this area divded by the determinant of the full transformation. Similar to what we did before, we can compute the area of that output parallelogram by creating a new matrix whose first column is the output vector, and whose second column is the same as the original matrix.  So, again, just using data from the output space, the numbers we see in our original linear system, we can recover the x-coordinate of our mystery input vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{\\text{Area}}{\\text{det}(A)} = \\frac{\\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)}{\\text{det}\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -1 \\\\0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula for finding the solutions to a linear system of equations is known as **Cramer's rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, Cramers rule suggest that the y coordinate should be $4/2$, or $2$, and that is indeed the value of the y-coordinate of the input vector we started with here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Dimensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The case with three dimensions is similar, we have a known transformation, given by a 3x3 matrix, and a known output vector, given by the right side of our linear system, and we want to know what input vector lands on that output. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of, say, the z-coordinate of the input vector as the volume of this parallelepiped, spanned by $\\hat{i}, \\hat{j}$ and the mystery input vector, what happens to the volume of this parallelopiped after the transformation?\n",
