    "\n",
    "Probability Sampling Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct a list of all units in population aka a **sampling frame**\n",
    "2. Determine the probability of selection for every unit on list (known and non-zero)\n",
    "3. Select units from list at random, with sampling rates for different subgroups determined by probabilities of selection\n",
    "4. Attempt to measure randomly selected units\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Probability Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "All non probabilities of selection, which make it difficult to make inference on selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Opt-in Web Surveys\n",
    "2. Quota Sampling\n",
    "3. Snowball sampling\n",
    "4. Convenience sampling (collecting data from people on the street, or classes, no probabilites of selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "Main problem - no statistical basis for making inference about the target population, high potential for bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Probability Sampling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random selection of population units protects us against bias from the sample selection mechanism, allows us to make population inferences based on sampling distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Big Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "With careful sample design, probability samples yield representative, realistic, random samples from larger populations, and such samples have important properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**, and links to i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) data\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining a representative selection of values from a possible sample of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- With SRS we start with a known list of $N$ population units, and randomly select $n$ units from the list. \n",
    "- Every unit has **equal probability of selection** = $\\frac{n}{N}$\n",
    "- All possible samples of size $n$ are equally likely\n",
    "- Estimates of means, proportions, and totals based on SRS are unbiased (equal to the population values on average)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be with replacement or without replacement\n",
    "- For both: probability of selection for each unit still $\\frac{n}{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- SRS rarely used in practice ~ collecting data from $n$ randomly samples units in large populations can be expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "SRS is usually done when samples are smaller and less expensive to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "SRS Connection to I.I.D data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall: i.i.d observations are independent and identically distributed\n",
    "- SRS will generate i.i.d data for a given variable, in theory...\n",
    "\n",
    "### SRS **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Service database, N=2500 email requests in 2018\n",
    "- Director wants to estimatae, mean email response time\n",
    "- Exact calculation require manual review of each email trend\n",
    "- Asks analytics team: sample, process and analyze $n = 100$ emails\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process the first 100 emails on the list\n",
    "- Estimated mean could be biased if customer service representatives learn or get better over time at responding more quickly. \n",
    "- First 100 observations may come from a small group of staff, not fully representative, independent, or identically distributed. \n",
    "- No random selection according to specific probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number emails 1 to 2500 and randomly select 100 using a random number generator\n",
    "- Every email has a known probabiity of selection = $\\frac{100}{2500}$\n",

    "## Non - Probability Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Probabilities of select that govern the sampled units**\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Non-Probability samples\n",
    "- Probabilies of selection **can not be determined** for sampled units\n",
    "- **No Random selection** of individual units\n",
    "- Samples can be divided into groups (strata) or clusters, but **clusters are not randomly sampled** in earlier stages\n",
    "- Data colection ofter very **cheap** relative to probability sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study of **volunteers**, in clinical trials (because the researcher does not have any control over whose probabilies of selection will be included in the study)\n",
    "- **Opt-in** / Intercept web surveys\n",
    "- **Snowball** sampling - sample grows by people telling others\n",
    "- **Convenience** samples, when university try to sample people from a specific class or during a specific time of day\n",
    "- **Quota** samples - certain targets that you try to meet to get a certain sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Feature\n",
    "Probabilities of selection **cannot be determined** a priori (before you actually begin the study), this is the crucial difference between probability sampling vs. non-probability sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a non-probability sample there is **no statistical basis for making inference** about larger population from which sample selected, because we don't control the probabilities of selection. \n",
    "- **Knowing probabilities of selection** - in addition to population strata and randomly samples clusters\n",
    "    - Can estimate features of sampling distribution, if were to take many random samples using same design\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sampled units are **not selected at random** - We don't know these random probabilities of being included in a given sample, and we don't use random selection (strong risk of **sampling bias**)\n",
    "- Sampled units **not generally representative** of larger target population of interest\n",
    "- **\"Big Data\"** (information from millions of tweets) - **often from non-probability samples**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have no statistical basis for making conclusions about the larger population given these design features. \n",
    "\n",
    "** So what can we do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many data sets arise from non-probability samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elliott and Valliant, provided a technical deep dive in 2017, statistical science journal mentioning they can provide many different estimation approaches for using non-probability sampling data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Possible Approaches**\n",
    "    - Pseduo-Randomization (with some work, we treat the non-probability sample like a probability sample)\n",
    "    - Calibration (weight the non-probability sample to look more like the population you are interested)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pseduo-Randomization Approach**\n",
    "    - **Combine non-probability sample with a probability sample** that collected similar measurements (\"stack\" data sets together), both samples must collect similar measurements\n",
    "    - **Estimate probability of being included in non-probability sample** as a function of auxiliary information available in both samples\n",
    "    - **Treat estimated probabilities of selection as \"known\"** for non-probability sample, use probability sampling methods for analysis\n",
    "   \n",
    "Using an indicator to determine whether your in the probability sample, or the non-probability sample. Then use logistic regression to estimate the probability of being in that non-probability sample as a function of all these other variables (age, gender etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Calibration\" Approach\"**\n",
    "    - **Compute weights for responding units** in a non-probability sample that allow weighted sampled to mirror a known population\n",
    "        - We want it to mirror the population, so we determine the weights of say males vs females then down/up grade each weight based off what the population represents.\n",
    "        - This is specifically important if this characteristic (kind of imbalance) is correlated with a variable we are interested in that we ultimately want to make population statements about. \n",
    "        - If our sample looks more like the population in terms of a characteristic that has a strong correlation with our variables of interest, we'll get closer and closer to making unbiased statements about the population. \n",
    "        - **Limitation**: if weighting factor not related to variable(s) of interest will not reduce possible sampling bias\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "API to extract info from several hundred thousand tweets and indicator of support for President Trump computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability** of a tweet being selected **cannot be determined**.  \n",
    "- **Twitter users not a random sample** of a larger population\n",
    "- **Lots of data**\n",
    "    - High Potential for sampling bias\n",
    "    - lack of representation: may only capture people with strong opinions\n",

    "### What is a Sampling Distribution?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Assume** values on variable of interest would follow certain distributions _if we could measure entire population_\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we select probability samples to make inferential statements about larger populations, we refer to a **sampling distribution**\n",
    "- **Sampling Distribution** is a distribution of **survey estimates** we would see if we selected many random samples using **same sample design** and **computed an estimate from each**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Properties\n",
    "- **Hypothetical** What would happen if we had luxury of drawing thousands of probability samples and measuring each of them?\n",
    "- Generally very **different in appearance from distribution of values on a single variable of interest...**\n",
    "- With **large enough probability sample size**, sampling distribution of estimates will look like a **normal distribution**, regardless of what estimates are being computed. **Central Limit Theorem: CLT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**CLT** The larger our sample size gets, the more that this distribution of estimates is going to tend towards normality as we draw more and more estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Sampling Variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling Variance** is the variability in the estimates described by the sampling distribution. \n",
    "- Because we select a **sample** and do not measure everyone in a **population** a survey estimate based on a **single sample will not** be exactly equal to the population quantity of interest (we are selecting cases at random)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A sampling distribution is the distribution of all possible estimates that would aris from hypothetical repeated sampling, and larger sample sizes will result in a sampling distribution with less variance, meaning that estimates are more precise. "
